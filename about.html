		<p class="content-desc">Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processed by computer systems. Such processes include learning by acquisition of information and information using rules, reasoning, and self-correction. There are three specific applications of AI: Expert systems, Speech recognition, and Machine vision. Artificial intelligence is basically the constellation of a variety of technologies, basically from machine learning to natural language processing. More straightforwardly, AI transform the relationship between human and technology and allows digital machines to sense, comprehend, act and learn. AI promises a new era in information technology development and human ingenuity accelerates its speed and precision. Despite having a lot of challenges or risk factors by the volume, velocity and variety of data (mega data) in this technology booming century, AI solution makes most sense of understanding in human development by adding maximum values to the business ventures. Expansion of AI renders tremendous impact on people.</p>

		<p class="text-desc">There are basically four types of AI, reactive machine, limited memory, theory of mind, and self-awareness. Reactive machine is a problem solving robotics technique that impacts the healthcare sector. Surgeons are using robots in super risk involving tasks. Supermarket retails is replacing human labor. “Unimate” was the first robot used in an assembly line for general motors. There is also limited memory which only works using programmed technology, thus performs limited tasks as designed. Theory of mind recognizes other minds in intelligent social interaction. It includes beliefs, desires, goals, and intentions in programming computers. Corporate giants like Google, Facebook, and IBM are investing billions of dollars in AI so as to bring together some of the brightest minds in the business ventures. Lastly, self-awareness are human-like machine, for example, Synth has become self-aware, banding together in social interaction in the communities. The basic understanding of self-awareness is the determination of the level of consciousness by computer programming in the real world. Quantification of consciousness, identifying disease, deep learning to solve computational tasks are attainable when machines are set with their own goals and act according to achieve their goals rather than to act as they are programmed.</p>

		<p class="content-desc23">Robotics is a large branch of AI in computer science with big and broad-spectrum futures, which deals with the simulation of the human intelligent process by a machine. The function of the robotics branch of AI is basically dependent on many factors, including designing, construction, operation and applications of robots. Considerable attention has been paid to the development of different types of AI in robotics and classified as strong and weak artificial intelligence. When AI is designed for a program it is classified as weak or narrow artificial intelligence. For example, Siri is the best narrowed AI that deals with an approach that deals with the simulation of human cognitive function. Such technological advances is strongly limited by restricted rules imposed by the programmer. The strong artificial intelligence is also called Artificial General Intelligence that has the capacity to find a solution for a new task or problem, although a lot of controversies can still occur.</p>
